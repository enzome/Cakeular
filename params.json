{"name":"Cakeular","tagline":"","body":"# Cakeular CakePHP Plugin\r\n\r\nCakeular is a Angular.js Plugin for CakePHP. It creates a RESTful JSON API service from your models and Angular.js views. \r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nThe master branch has the following requirements:\r\n\r\n* CakePHP 2.2.0 or greater.\r\n* PHP 5.3.0 or greater.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n1. Clone/Copy the files in this directory into `app/Plugin/Cakeular`.\r\n2. Ensure the plugin is loaded in `app/Config/bootstrap.php` by calling `CakePlugin::loadAll(array('Cakeular' => array('routes' => true)));`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n/**\r\n * ... connect Cakeular RESTful URLs to JSON API.\r\n */\r\n\tRouter::connect('/:controller/*', array('action' => 'index'));\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Install as Git submodule\r\n\r\nYou can replace Step 1 above with the following to add Cakeular to your CakePHP project as a submodule:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd /path/to/CakePHP/project/\r\n$ git submodule add https://github.com/mcred/Cakeular.git app/Plugin/Cakeular\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) \r\n\r\nYour server must allow CORS from the requesting application. This can be enabled a few ways. The easiest I have found is to allow the host for my application to the .htaccess file in the /app folder. Add the following line: `Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin \"localhost or yourserver\"`\r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\n\r\n## Cakeular Console Templates\r\n\r\nWe have included Console Templates to allow you to easily bake a project and gain Angular functionality throughout.\r\n\r\nTo utilize the Console Templates simply bake your project like usual but select `Cakeular` when it asks you which template you would like to use.\r\n\r\n##API Routes\r\n\r\nThe standard Cake controller methods are replaced by a RESTful JSON API. So instead of viewing an individual record for your model by going to `/model/view/:id`, JSON data for this record can be seen by a GET request to `/model/:id`. The replacement for Cake methods are as follows:\r\n\r\n`/model/index/` becomes a GET request to `/model/`\r\n`/model/view/:id` becomes a GET request to `/model/:id`\r\n`/model/add` becomes a POST request to `/model/`, send the model as the 'body' of a POST as a JSON string.\r\n`/model/edit/:id` becomes a POST request to `/model/`, send the model as the 'body' of a POST as a JSON string.\r\n`/model/delete:id` becomes a DELETE request to `/model/`\r\n\r\n\r\n# TODO\r\n\r\n* Add Angular.js templates to replace the standard cake view templates\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
